What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge will make a new commit that will contain the changes from the branch you're merging into and the branch you're merging from. This will preserve the history of both branches as the history will show the the merge commit came from both parent branches and not rewrite or destroy any history. This means it is easy to tell when a branch was merged. Git rebase will take the commits from the rebased branch and move it to after the most recent commit of the target branch. This action will show a linear sequence of commits and re-write the project history to show that the commits from the rebased branch came after the commits from the target branch. This means that is it more difficult to tell where the second branch was created as the commit history of the rebased branch is rewritten. Rebase does allow for a more clean and linear commit history. Rebase can cause an issue where if a branch is being worked on by multiple people, and one person performs a rebase then their branch history will be out of sync compared to everyone else's leading to them have to synchronize their branch with the main branch everyone else was working on through a merge.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a central online repository that enables collaboration. It enables developers to push changes from their local repositories onto a central repository that other developers can see. It allows developers to also take changes made on the remote repository and update their local repositories enabling collaboration.
